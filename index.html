         We are working with the Shanghai Municipal Electricity Power Company of State Grid Corporation of China to construct an e-learning platform for construction cost and other knowledge in the construction industry.
       </p>
       <p class="w3-justify">
         Power transmission and transformation project requires cross-disciplinary cooperation among project participants who should learn about knowledge of other disciplinaries to improve the effectiveness of collaboration. However, the extensive theoretical literature, books, contract texts, and cases in the database are fragmented and difficult to search and learn.
       
       </p>
      
       <p class="w3-justify">
         We designed a prototype of the e-learning platform based on the knowledge graph in the form of a search engine with a case library and a graphical knowledge network. To achieve this, we designed a process to build a knowledge graph in the construction industry, including entity extraction, ontology construction, relationship extraction, attribute extraction. Working with experts in different disciplines, we constructed over 300 OWL ontologies on protégé.

         Beijing Daxing International Airport is an integrated air-ground transportation hub. 
         This project is the largest airport project in the world. 
         It is a complex system with a large volume, numerous interfaces and a large number of stakeholders, 
         but it only took four years and seven months from the start of construction and the start of operation. 
         Therefore, it is necessary to study the governance mode, management methods, and new technologies.
       </p>
       <p class="w3-justify">
         We interview 28 managers of BDIA project to study the philosophy and methods to manage such a megaproject.

         We try to figure out the key stakeholders and summarize the governance mode of BDIA project by building an affiliation network of stakeholders based on the meeting munites.

              Appropriate enablers are essential for the promotion of environmental practices in the project context. 
              The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate whether team knowledge, government policies and corporate strategies are conducive to project environmental practices. 
              A theoretical model was established and several hypotheses were developed. 
              Based on a sample of 131 questionnaires, structural equation modelling analysis was conducted. 
              The results show that corporate strategies and team knowledge are confirmed to influence project environmental practices positively. 
              Government policies positively impact corporate strategies, and corporate strategies have a positive impact on team knowledge.

        Formation of cooperative air pollution control alliance in inter-provincial and multi-city regions: Based on evolutionary game analysis.

        <p>The non-territorial nature of air pollution determines that the governance of air pollution needs to break the inter-provincial barriers of territorial governance, 
          and form an inter-provincial multi-city air pollution cooperative governance alliance. 
          This article will use the evolutionary game method to analyze the stable strategies of air pollution control under the four scenarios of multiple urban entities 
          in a trans-provincial area, 
          which are unconstrained territorial governance, constrained territorial governance, 
          spontaneous formation of cooperative governance alliance under constrained territorial governance, 
          and cooperative governance alliance that breaks territorial governance. 
          The results show that unconstrained territorial governance will lead to continuous deterioration of the environment, 
          the governance efficiency of constrained territorial governance is low, 
          the spontaneously formed cooperative governance alliance cannot solve the fundamental problems brought by territorial governance, 
          and the cooperative governance alliance is a relatively optimal air pollution control plan. 
          This article provides a certain reference for the design of air pollution control mechanism.

        Policies for promoting star-rated green housing – static subsidy vs. dynamic subsidy.  
        <a><i>Computers & Industrial Engineering</i></a>
       </h5>
      <img src="dp1.png" alt="dp1" width="100%">
         <p>
          To explore how to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of government subsidy to promote the star-rated green housing, 
          we analyzed the strategies of developers and consumers under three policies based on evolutionary game theory: 
          static subsidy to developers, 
          static subsidy to developers and consumers, 
          and dynamic subsidy to developers and consumers. 
          We discussed the influence of the amount and the distribution proportion of subsidy on the stable strategy. 
          Then, we did the numerical simulation. The results show that: 
          1) under the static subsidy policy, the system is oscillating, and the subsidy cannot promote star-rated green housing; 
          2) dynamic subsidy to developers and consumers can make the system stable and promote star-rated green housing; 
          3) the amount and the distribution proportion of subsidy need to be determined by the government through numerical simulation. 
          This study provides a reference for designing the promotion mechanism of star-rated green housing.
